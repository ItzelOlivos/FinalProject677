# FinalProject677

This project proposes a methodology to solve a multi- agent control problem that involves collision avoidance and tracking under uncertainty. To ensure scalability, the proposed solution is a distributed approach that uses Flocking, a form of collective behavior that emerges from local interactions, to solve the control problem and a consensus-based filtering algorithm that requires a minimum of computation, communication, and synchronization to solve the tracking problem. Experiments show that the proposed methodology solves the task successfully. Furthermore, the experiments show the compromises induced by the different configurations of hyperparameters

To execute just run main.py, no fancy libraries required :)
